              <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>

              <p>
                Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small
                rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of
                ropes or harnesses.
              </p>

              <p>
                Unlike

                  >traditional climbing</a
                >, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called
                "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance
                from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of
                moves.
