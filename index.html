        <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
        <p>
          Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock
          formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or
          harnesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike traditional climbing, bouldering focuses on short but intensive
          routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe
          distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of
          moves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experience the perfect blend of physical challenge and mental
          puzzle-solving as you navigate routes close to the ground, with
          nothing but a crash pad and determination. Bouldering strips climbing
          down to its purest form, making it both accessible to beginners and
          endlessly challenging for experts.
