        <h2>How to get started</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike many outdoor sports, getting started with bouldering is
          surprisingly simple. All you need are some climbing shoes, chalk, and
          a positive attitude—most gyms even rent the equipment for your first
          sessions.
          <strong>No prior experience or complex gear required!</strong>
        </p>
